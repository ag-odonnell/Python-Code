# Python
## Python Code Repository (python-code-repo)
### Overview
This repository is used to store Python code created for various projects. It will also contain a Snippet container that will store self-contained SAS code used to test various Python procedures, macro statements and general logic. The repo is divided into two main directories: Python Projects and Python Snippets.

-	Python Projects contain generic code that can be repurposed for specific applications.
-	Python Snippets contains self-contained code that tests SAS features and coding logic.

### Prerequisites
Before you can connect to your data source using these programs, you must have a SAS engine to run the code:
- Examples of SAS engines that may be used to execute the commands:
  - Python 3
  - Google Colab
  - Deep Note
  - Kaggle

### Installation
To load the programs into the editor in Python:
1. Click the download button on the right-hand side of the samples repository page on GitHub.
2. Save the project on your computer.
3. In the Explorer tab of the left-hand navigation pane, navigate to where you saved the sample files and open them.

To load the programs into the program editor in Python windowing environment:
1. Click the download button on the right-hand side of the samples repository page on GitHub.
2. Save the project on your computer
3. Click File > Open Program
4. Navigate to where you saved the sample files and open them.

Getting started with Google Colab, I found a towardsdatascience document helpful, refer [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/getting-started-with-google-colab-f2fff97f594c)
### Getting Started
To use the sample programs on your machine:
1. The sample files should be executed in the following order:

    - Copy the code to your Python session
    - Run the code

2. Replace the comments in various places with appropriate file paths, data source and variable information.
